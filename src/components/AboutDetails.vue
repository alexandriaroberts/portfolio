        I am Lexie and I am a
        <span class="about__text-decoration">self-taught developer.</span>
        <br />
        <br />I did take a
        <span class="about__text-decoration">Computer Science Degree</span> years ago which to be honest I don't think was that useful, but the great thing is I was awarded a full scholarship 
        from 10,000 applicants to study masters degree in International Managemnet at University Of Sussex because of it.ðŸ˜Šâœ¨

      <p class="content paragraph__2">
        For few years, I found myself doing variety of jobs from waitressing, personal assistant, club promoter to administrator for a financial company. Almost all jobs I did I feel like
         were important for me to grow as a person and I enjoyed them very well. <br /><br> <br> 
       
          But since last couple of years I found myself doing some deep thinking & realised how much I
        <span
          class="about__text-decoration"
        >loved</span> using my brain and coding while at uni, also loved mathematics in school, working on a problem and finding solutions to it. Since then I started learning to code again while doing part-time jobs.
        I also started to work as a
        <span
          class="about__text-decoration"
        >volunteer developer</span> at
        <a href="shelovesdata.com" class="link-job">she loves data</a> to gain experinece & help with their website.
        <br /><br />
        <br />So far I have done few projects including this portfolio, a game in
        <span
          class="about__text-decoration"
        >VueJS</span> &
        few projects on CSS Grid. I also have found myself loving
        <span
          class="about__text-decoration"
        >JavaScript</span> despite finding it challenging at times. You can see all my code on
        <span
          class="about__text-decoration"
        >Github</span> or
        <span class="about__text-decoration">Codepen</span>.
        <br /><br />
        <br />Currently, I am looking for a front-end position with a supportive team where I can expand my skills and grow as
        a developer, my interest lies in
        <span
          class="about__text-decoration"
        >JavaScript</span>,
        <span class="about__text-decoration">SVG</span> and
        <span class="about__text-decoration">VueJS</span>. I also love working with
        <span class="about__text-decoration">CSS Grid</span>.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        <br/>
        In my leisure time, I love visiting natureðŸŒ³, going for long swims and cooking.ðŸ¤¤ðŸ¥£ðŸ¥—
